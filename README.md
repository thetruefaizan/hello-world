# hello-world

Oh hai!

I'm an 18-year-old A-level Computer Sciene student with aspirations of going to a top-class university in the near future! I'm very much into machine learning, and I'm beginning to scratch the surface on some of the most well-known machine learning algorithms! I know HTML and CSS to a good standard, and hope (actually, need) to learn JavaScript some day, when I give myself the time.
